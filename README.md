## HW2: Reproduction of WALL DRAWING 11 in Processing ##
  Desription: A wall divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed.

  Elements: lines in 4 directions: horizontal, vertical, 45 diagonal right and 45 diagonal left
  
  Step: Split the plane into grids(get the horizental&vertical lines);
        Draw the diagonal lines in 4 steps(to get the four parts artificially)
        
 Composition: The whole picture will be generated by code instantly, be like

##HW3: The style of Mondrian
  Desription: Try to reproduce the style of Monderian
  
  Elements: 1)basic lines; 2)rectangulars; 3)ellipses;
  
  Step: Choose a basic element;
        Choose the colors;
        Choose the way all the elements are arranged.
        (Since I was struggling with PROCESSING, I illustrated the steps from exsiting coding work, and then generated in my own way.)
