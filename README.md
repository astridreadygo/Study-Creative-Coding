## HW2: Reproduction of WALL DRAWING 11 in Processing ##
  Desription: A wall divided horizontally and vertically into four equal parts. Within each part, three of the four kinds of lines are superimposed.

  Elements: lines in 4 directions: horizontal, vertical, 45 diagonal right and 45 diagonal left
  
  Step: Split the plane into grids(get the horizental&vertical lines);
        Draw the diagonal lines in 4 steps(to get the four parts artificially)
        
 Composition: The whole picture will be generated by code instantly, be like

##HW3: The style of Mondrian##
  Desription: Try to reproduce the style of Monderian
  
  Elements: 1)basic lines, the code of first line of blocks is from funprogramming from PROCESSING. And the next two lines are works I learned from the first one
  (https://funprogramming.org/18-Things-that-happen-sometimes.html);
  
  2)rectangulars, I try to make it interactive; 
  
  3)ellipses, I try to make it animated, since I found that in Mondrian's work Tree, ellipses can be a kind of basic element;
  
  Step: Choose a basic element;
        Choose the colors;
        Choose the way all the elements are arranged.
        (Since I was struggling with PROCESSING, I illustrated the steps from exsiting coding work, and then generated in my own way.)
